# Classification-of-choledoch-using-Ensemble-methods
This project explores deep learningâ€“based classification of choledoch (common bile duct) conditions using multiple CNN architectures. A total of seven deep learning models were trained and evaluated individually, followed by the application of ensemble fusion strategies to enhance predictive performance.
Ensemble methods such as stacking, simple averaging, and dynamic weighted averaging were implemented to combine the strengths of different models. The approach achieved higher accuracy and robustness compared to any single model, demonstrating the effectiveness of ensemble learning in medical image analysis.

**Key Features:**
1. Training and evaluation of 7 deep learning architectures.
2. Ensemble strategies: stacking, averaging, and dynamic weighted averaging.
3. Comparative analysis of individual vs ensemble model performance.
4. Visualization of prediction outcomes and accuracy improvements.
